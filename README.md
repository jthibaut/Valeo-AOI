# Valeo-AOI
ENS Data challenge competition for a Valeo subsidiary

This is a data challenge proposed by ENS Challenge data
https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/58/

The target of this challenge was to define a model that could provide a better result than the Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) to dis-
criminate between good and bad parts for aspect defects.

I implemented a deep learning model using VGG-16 algorithm to predict the true and false defect parts.
